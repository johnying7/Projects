# Projects

Projects contains folders dedicated to work I've done in coding that is relevant to Computer Science.

Recent Personal Project is the Navigation System based on the A* pathfinding algorithm applied to Unity3D.
The demo runs the program in a visual format coded myself using the Unity3D engine (to close the application, hit escape).


The KU folder contains School lab work for Programming II in Fall 2015.
